            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Ith my laſt, I ſent you word of the ſurrender of <hi>Warmore</hi> Caſtle un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, and I might ſay much of the further particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars thereof, but that I doubt not but ere this you have heard of it at large: Immediately thereupon we drew on our Leaguer before <hi>Deal-Caſtle,</hi> where we now lie; and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:116623:3"/>on Saturday morning the 15. of this inſtant <hi>July,</hi> there appeared ſix men of War, (being part of the revolted Ships,) before the Town and Caſtle of <hi>Deal,</hi> and by their churliſh tokens they ſent us, made it appear to us what they were, for they ſhot very near a hundred great Pieces at us, yet thanks be to the Lord, they did us little harm; only two men were ſlain by their ſhot, and two more by the fall of a Chimney which their Canon beat down; That very morning alſo the enemy ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied out of <hi>Deal</hi> Caſtle, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to ſurprize our forlorn guard, which was between three and four hundred yards of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle; but they were ſoon diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:116623:3"/>and by a Reſerve guard, (whom Captain <hi>Gayl</hi> of <hi>Coleman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet</hi> commanded) they were gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly repulſed, and driven back to the very gate of the Caſtle, and this with the loſſe of three of our men, and ſome few wounded: As for the loſſe on the Enemies part, it is hot certain yet ſome of our Souldiers obſerved about eight or nine of theirs to be carried off on pick pack.</p>
            <p>The day following being Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, there appeared near about 30. <hi>Fleming</hi> Ships before the Caſtle and Town of <hi>Deal,</hi> but are very quiet, and have not yet medled on either ſide, neither have the revolt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Ships at all oppoſed us ſince the arrivall of the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> which
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:116623:4"/>encourageth us to hope that they are rather our friends then ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. The Enemies in the Caſtle are madly deſperate, and our men very valiant and couragious. But in regard the two Caſtles of <hi>Deal</hi> and <hi>Sandown</hi> are at ſuch a diſtance that our ſmall forces are not able to beſiege both at once, and yet ſo near that they may in ſome ſort aſsiſt each other, we are forced to keep our ſtrength united as neer as poſsibly we can, leſt we be made a prey to their frequent excurſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on both ſides. But we daily expect an additionall ſtrength to come to us, and then we hope we ſhall be able to bridle their rage, and make them keep within ſtraighter bounds. In the mean
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:116623:4"/>time our Souldiers are very buſié in making Canon baskets and ſuch other neceſſaries for our ſervice, and we have begun to raiſe a new Battery between the Town of <hi>Deal,</hi> and the Caſtle of <hi>Sandown,</hi> by which meanes we ſhall be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to command the Sea, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to keep off relief, and ſecure our ſelves from the annoyance of thoſe ſhips that ſhall attempt againſt us. In a word, every thing is preparing for the Leaguer with all conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſpeed that may be, and our ſtout Souldiery will ere long be in action.</p>
            <p>It is reported that the Prince, Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and many hundreds of Souldiers are in the Revolted Ships, but there is very little rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for that opinion, and not the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:116623:5"/>leaſt likelihood of the truth of it. But if they were, yet we fear them not, they are like to have but a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly welcome on ſhore, if they come in this poſture; for we are reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely reſolved to oppoſe both them and all others to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt that come in ſuch a way. In the interim, if the Lord will but ſend us ſeaſonable weather, our works will go on apace and be ſpeedily finiſhed. As for Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on bleſſed be God, it is at a very reaſonable rate. This may ſuffice at preſent from.</p>
